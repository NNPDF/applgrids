# applgrids
APPLgrids for NNPDF

## Project summary and aim

The aim of this repository is to store the "official" APPLgrids used by the NNPDF Collaboration.
Several grids stored here have been computed with the `external` repository, 
however, a smaller number of grids have been generated from experimental collaborations or th. colleagues.

Each folder matches the name of the dataset registered in the `apfelcomb` project database and 
reflects the official name used in NNPDF fits through the `buildmaster` implementation.

Each folder contains a specific README file with the summary information about the grid origin and usage.

# Testing tools

The appltest directory contains some basic tools for making predictions from
APPLgrid files.
